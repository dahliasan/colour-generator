# Overview
Users can generate a colour palette by providing a seed colour. There is a range of palette types they can choose from. This app generates the colours from [The Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/).

This is a project from the [Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) by Scrimba.

## Scrimba project requirements

- Choose ‚Äúseed colour‚Äù with an `<input type=‚Äúcolor‚Äù />`
- Choose colour scheme mode in a `<select>` box
- Clicking button makes request to The Color API to get a colour scheme
- Display the scheme colours and hex values on the page

## Extra features I added
